# Core system monitoring and interaction
psutil>=5.9.0

# Hardware and system information
# cpuinfo is often installed via OS package manager or pip, but not always available
# GPUtil requires nvidia-ml-py or pynvml for full functionality
# For CPU info: py-cpuinfo (alternative to built-in cpuinfo module)
py-cpuinfo>=9.0.0
pynvml>=11.5.0 # For GPU monitoring via GPUtil or direct access

# Numerical and Scientific Computing (for AI/Quantum simulation, data processing)
numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0

# AI/ML Frameworks (Core for HJK-QUANTUM AI aspects)
tensorflow>=2.8.0
# OR PyTorch (choose one, or both if needed, though they can sometimes conflict)
# torch>=1.12.0

# GUI Framework (Aligns with HJK-QUANTUM's "advanced GUI" and GY concept)
customtkinter>=5.0.0 # Or 'customtkinter' depending on the specific library used
# tkinter usually comes with Python standard library, but CTk requires it

# Networking and Communication (for remote jobs, HJK-QUANTUM API interaction, TY actions)
requests>=2.28.0
aiohttp>=3.8.0 # For asynchronous HTTP requests (e.g., in remote job engine)
# websockets>=10.0 # If using WebSocket communication for HOKU or remote jobs

# Data Serialization and Formats
# json is part of the standard library
# pickle is part of the standard library
# yaml (requires PyYAML)
PyYAML>=6.0

# Database (for metrics, system state, FOGU logs)
# sqlite3 is part of the standard library

# Asynchronous Programming (for HOKU, WAVE, System Intelligence tasks)
# asyncio is part of the standard library

# Concurrency (for TY actions, system tasks)
# threading is part of the standard library
# concurrent.futures is part of the standard library

# Cryptography (for FOGU security, ZBT encryption)
# cryptography>=3.4.8 # Example, if encryption is implemented

# System Interaction (for process tracking, system calls)
# os, sys, subprocess are standard library

# Logging (standard library used, but can be enhanced)
# logging is part of the standard library

# Testing/Development (optional, for validation)
pytest>=7.0.0 # If unit/integration tests are added later

# Optional: For advanced profiling (mentioned in summary)
# cProfile and pstats are standard library
# memory_profiler>=0.61.0 # Example external profiler

# Optional: For specific HJK-QUANTUM integration (if it provides a Python API)
# hjk_quantum_api_client # This would be a hypothetical package provided by HJK-QUANTUM, not available on PyPI

# The HJK-QUANTUM project itself is referenced via its GitHub repo and license,
# not installed as a standard pip package based on the provided info.
# Its "Megabit Quantum technology" and AI libraries are concepts integrated into this OS,
# not necessarily direct pip-installable dependencies themselves.

# Note: Versions are set to reasonably recent stable versions.
# Always check the latest versions and compatibility requirements for your specific use case.
# Some libraries might require specific system dependencies (e.g., compilers for numpy/scipy, CUDA for GPU-accelerated TF/PyTorch).
